# Phonebook Application

Welcome to the **Phonebook Application** repository! This project is a part of
the GoIT React homework assignments and aims to demonstrate my skills in
building a phonebook management application using React.

## About the Project

The **Phonebook Application** allows users to store and manage their contacts.
It provides functionalities to add new contacts, edit existing ones, and delete
contacts from the phonebook. The application also supports search functionality,
enabling users to quickly find specific contacts by name or phone number.

## Technologies Used

The project is developed using **React**, a popular JavaScript library for
building user interfaces. It follows best practices and utilizes various
features of React, such as component composition, state management, and event
handling. Additionally, **CSS** styles have been applied to create an intuitive
and visually appealing user interface.
